# Kristen-Marketing-Blog

## Description
As a marketing student, I wanted to create a website where I can share my experiences in class and offer advice for those who are interested in pursuing a marketing degree. I feel that a blog would be the best way to share updates with anyone who visits my blog. Additionally, giving access to others would offer more insight on what it's like to be a marketing student. I learned how to create a 2-page website, and the different ways the localStorage works.

## Instllation
I started by creating 2 HTML pages: One for my landing page, where users can create content; and one to view the blogs. I then had to create 3 CSS files, one for the landing page's styles, one for the blog page's styles, and another that contained the styles for the dark mode switch and the header. I also created 3 JavaScript files for the landing page, the blog page and the functions needed for the dark mode switch.

## Usage
If a user is interested in visiting this website, they will first need to enter a custom username of their choice, a title for their blog, and blog content. Users also have the option to view the website in dark mode by clicking on the switch in the header. This option applies for both pages. Once the user has completed writing their blog, they will need to hit the submit button. After, they will have access to view their blog, along with old content that was posted on the website.
